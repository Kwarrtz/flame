# Flame

This is a Rust implementation of the fractal flame algorithm for generating colorful fractal-like images, as described in [this paper](http://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf) by Scott Draves and Erik Reckase. The flame algorithm is itself an extension of a another method of generating fractals, known as [linear iterated function systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system) or IFS. Below is an example of an image generated by this software.

Most of the features described in the paper are supported. Symmetry, density estimation and some of the variations in the appendix remain to be implemented.

This is a personal project for educational purposes. It is currently highly unstable and not intended for public use. If you actually want to experiment with creating your own fractal flames, I'd instead suggest checking out one of the pieces of software linked to on [the official flame website](https://flam3.com). All credit for the algorithm implemented here goes to Scott Draves and his colleagues.

## Command-line interface

The primary executable in this crate is `cli`, which renders flames from a specification file in either YAML or JSON format. The specification used to generate the image above can be found in the `examples` folder. For usage of the command-line tool and a description of the various rendering options, see the `--help` flag.

## Graphical interface

There is also a graphical editor implemented in the `gui` executable, using the same rendering backend. Currently, all it does is allow for a continuous live preview as you edit a YAML flame specification, in the same format as used by the command-line utility.
